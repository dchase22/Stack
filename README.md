# Stack Class Implementation
This repository contains a small project that demonstrates the implementation of a basic stack data structure in C#. The project includes:

**Stack Class**: A class that provides standard stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. \n
**Client Code**: A program file with simple client code that illustrates how to use the stack class with brief examples. \n
**Features** \n
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack. \n
Pop: Remove the top element from the stack. \n
Peek: Retrieve the top element without removing it. \n
isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty. \n
