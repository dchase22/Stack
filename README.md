Stack Class Implementation
This repository contains a small project that demonstrates the implementation of a basic stack data structure in JavaScript. The project includes:

Stack Class: A class that provides standard stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
Client Code: A simple client script that illustrates how to use the stack class with brief examples.
Features
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
Peek: Retrieve the top element without removing it.
isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
